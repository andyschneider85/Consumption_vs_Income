# Consumption_vs_Income 
Explores the relationship between per capita income levels and per capita spending on different consumer items,
in this case Beer, Chocolate, Premium Beauty and Personal Care, and Mass Beauty and Personal care. It pulls in data on beer consumption, 
chocolate chocolate consumption, premium beauty and personal care consumption, mass beauty and personal care consumption, and 
dispoable personal income (all in per capita terms) for 80 countries from 2000 to 2014 from Euromonitor. It cleans and transforms 
the data as necessary to plot a simple regression and smoothed Loess line for each consumption category against personal disposable income. From these plots we can get a quick idea of the category's S-curve showing key inflection points, specifically at what income level category consumption accelerates (takeoff) and at which level it slows (saturation).
